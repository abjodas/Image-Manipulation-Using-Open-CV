# Image Manipulation with OpenCV

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates various image manipulation techniques using OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision and image processing.

## Features

- Loading and displaying images
- Resizing and cropping images
- Applying geometric transformations
- Image filtering and edge detection
- Drawing shapes and text on images
- Basic color manipulation
- Image arithmetic operations

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- OpenCV (`cv2`) library
- Other optional dependencies listed in the notebook

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-manipulation-opencv.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd image-manipulation-opencv
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(You can create a `requirements.txt` file with the dependencies if needed.)*

4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Image_Manipulation_OpenCV.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

Open the notebook and execute the cells step by step to learn and experiment with image manipulation techniques. Modify the code and test it with your own images for further practice.

## Examples

### Resize and Crop
Learn how to resize images to different dimensions and crop specific parts.

### Geometric Transformations
Apply rotations, translations, and scaling to transform images.

### Edge Detection
Use Canny edge detection to extract edges from an image.

### Drawing Shapes
Overlay custom shapes and text on images for annotation or decoration.
